    "Title: Structure-based drug discovery with deep learning\nSummary: This paper addresses the growing potential of deep learning in structure-based drug discovery (SBDD), a field that leverages information on the target protein to identify and design new drugs. While deep learning has been widely adopted in ligand-based drug discovery, its application to SBDD is still in its early stages, despite the potential to address challenges such as polypharmacology, selectivity optimization, activity cliff prediction, and target deorphanization. The authors highlight that deep learning can learn directly from molecular representations of both ligands and proteins without explicit feature engineering, which is particularly advantageous for proteins due to their complexity. The review summarizes prominent algorithmic concepts in structure-based deep learning for drug discovery, focusing on how proteins can be represented at different levels of complexity (amino acid sequence, tertiary structure) for deep learning models. It then addresses state-of-the-art methods for drug-target interaction prediction, binding site detection, and de novo design. The authors discuss current limitations and research gaps, along with foreseen future directions and opportunities. They emphasize that accurate protein structure predictions, facilitated by AI breakthroughs like AlphaFold, are expected to accelerate computer-assisted SBDD by bridging the data availability gap. The paper presents an overview of protein representations for deep learning, including primary amino acid sequences (represented as character strings or graphs), tertiary three-dimensional structures (represented as grid-based voxels or molecular graphs), and protein surfaces (represented as meshes or point clouds), each with its own advantages and drawbacks in terms of information captured, computational cost, and data availability. Ultimately, the review forecasts increasing relevance of deep learning in SBDD in the coming years, with implications for accelerating drug discovery and tackling previously intractable challenges.",
    "Title: On How AI Needs to Change to Advance the Science of Drug Discovery\nSummary: This attention paper addresses the limitations of current machine learning (ML) approaches in advancing drug discovery, particularly concerning the reliance on correlations that often lead to spurious inferences due to the abundance of high-dimensional data in the life sciences. The main objective is to advocate for the incorporation of causal reasoning methods from AI/ML to overcome these limitations. The authors propose \"causal drug discovery\" as a framework for grounding the drug discovery process in causal reasoning. They begin by highlighting the successes and shortcomings of current ML applications in biology, such as protein structure prediction with AlphaFold2, while pointing out the issues with target identification where spurious correlations between gene expression and disease phenotypes can lead to false discoveries. The paper emphasizes that even in protein engineering, factors like DNA sequence and cotranslational folding, often overlooked by current algorithms, can significantly impact protein fitness. To address these issues, the authors suggest distinguishing between spurious and non-spurious associations and identifying hidden confounding variables. The paper then delves into the concept of causality, defining it as a key goal of scientific endeavor and formalizing it using Pearl's counterfactual theory of causation and Structural Causal Models (SCMs). SCMs, represented as a 4-tuple (V, U, F, P(U)), enable reasoning about interventions and counterfactuals, extending beyond the capabilities of Bayesian Networks by accommodating hidden confounders. The authors highlight the Pearl Causal Hierarchy (PCH), emphasizing that causal quantities are richer in information than statistical quantities and require causal information beyond observational data for inference. Ultimately, the paper argues that incorporating causal inference can resolve issues with current machine learning methods for protein engineering and contribute to further advancements in the field by explicating modeling assumptions needed for identifying true cause-effect relationships.",
    "Title: Synthetic Data from Diffusion Models Improve Drug Discovery Prediction\nSummary: This paper addresses the challenge of data sparsity in drug discovery, where datasets are often collected independently with limited overlap, hindering researchers from answering key questions requiring data spanning multiple datasets. To overcome this, the authors introduce Syngand, a novel end-to-end generative AI diffusion model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), capable of simultaneously generating ligand structures and their associated pharmacokinetic data. The Syngand model is trained to generate novel ligands along with synthetic pharmacokinetic data or to fill in missing pharmacokinetic data for existing ligands. The methodology involves training the model on a large dataset of 1.3 million ligands from Guacamol, augmented with pharmacokinetic data from AqSolDB (water solubility), LD50 (acute toxicity), and hERG Central (hERG inhibition). The authors also developed a methodology for sampling pharmacokinetic data for existing ligands using the Syngand model. The initial results demonstrate the efficacy of the generated synthetic data in improving performance on downstream drug discovery regression tasks for water solubility, acute toxicity, and hERG inhibition. The major contributions include the Syngand model itself, the methodology for sampling pharmacokinetic data, and the demonstration of the utility of synthetic data in augmenting real data for downstream pharmacokinetic tasks. The practical implication of this work is that researchers can use the Syngand model to generate synthetic ligand data to explore research questions that require data spanning multiple datasets, potentially accelerating drug discovery efforts. The theoretical implication is the demonstration of the effectiveness of diffusion models in generating high-quality synthetic data for complex scientific domains like drug discovery.",
    "Title: DTI-SNNFRA: Drug-Target interaction prediction by shared nearest\n  neighbors and fuzzy-rough approximation\nSummary: This paper addresses the challenge of predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) using computational methods, particularly in the context of drug repurposing, where existing drugs are investigated for new therapeutic applications. The authors highlight that traditional drug discovery is costly and time-consuming, while drug repurposing offers advantages like reduced development time and known side-effect profiles. However, the vast number of potential drug-target pairs leads to imbalanced datasets, posing a challenge for classification models. To overcome this, the authors propose DTI-SNNFRA, a novel framework based on shared nearest neighbors (SNN) and fuzzy-rough approximation (FRA). The methodology involves two key stages: first, SNN and partitioning clustering are employed to sample the search space, reducing the number of drug-target pairs under consideration. Subsequently, the degree of fuzzy-rough approximations is computed, and a threshold is applied to undersample negative samples from the remaining interaction pairs. This process aims to balance the dataset by strategically selecting negative samples. The classification is then performed using the resulting positive and selected negative samples. The authors evaluated the efficacy of DTI-SNNFRA using metrics like AUC, Geometric Mean, and F1 Score, achieving a high prediction score of 0.95 for ROC-AUC. The predicted drug-target interactions were validated using the Connectivity Map (Cmap) database. The key contribution of this work is the DTI-SNNFRA framework, which effectively addresses the imbalanced data problem in DTI prediction by combining SNN-based sampling with fuzzy-rough approximation for negative sample selection. This approach leads to a more balanced training dataset and improved prediction accuracy, as evidenced by the high ROC-AUC score. The practical implication is a more efficient and accurate in-silico method for identifying potential drug-target interactions, accelerating the drug repurposing process and potentially reducing the cost and time associated with traditional drug discovery."

While some focus on leveraging existing datasets and models, others emphasize the importance of generating synthetic data to address data sparsity. \"Synthetic Data from Diffusion Models Improve Drug Discovery Prediction\" introduces Syngand, a diffusion model for generating ligands and pharmacokinetic data, demonstrating the utility of synthetic data in augmenting real data and improving performance on downstream tasks. Furthermore, the papers highlight different approaches to protein representation in the context of structure-based drug discovery. \"Structure-based drug discovery with deep learning\" reviews how deep learning can learn directly from molecular representations of both ligands and proteins, summarizing prominent algorithmic concepts in the field. A contrasting perspective, however, is presented in \"On How AI Needs to Change to Advance the Science of Drug Discovery,\" which critically examines the limitations of current ML approaches, particularly concerning the reliance on correlations that can lead to spurious inferences. This paper advocates for the incorporation of causal reasoning methods to address these limitations and ground the drug discovery process in causal relationships.\n\nThe contrasting approaches to data handling, model development, and causal inference underline the evolving nature of the field. While some papers focus on optimizing existing ML models and datasets, others are exploring the use of LLMs, synthetic data, and causal reasoning to overcome inherent limitations. The practical implications across these papers are significant. AI-driven platforms and methodologies promise to accelerate drug discovery timelines, reduce costs, and improve the success rate of identifying promising drug candidates. The ability to automate workflows, integrate diverse datasets, and generate synthetic data can empower researchers to explore new research questions and develop more effective and personalized treatments. However, it is also crucial to acknowledge the challenges related to data quality, model interpretability, and the potential for spurious inferences. The call for incorporating causal reasoning in \"On How AI Needs to Change to Advance the Science of Drug Discovery\" serves as a critical reminder that AI should be used responsibly and ethically, with a focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease and drug action. The \"DTI-SNNFRA\" paper addresses the issue of imbalanced datasets, demonstrating the importance of developing specialized algorithms to handle the unique challenges of drug-target interaction prediction. In conclusion, the field is moving towards a more holistic and integrated approach to drug discovery, leveraging the power of AI while addressing its limitations and ethical implications."
